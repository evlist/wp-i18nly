# I18nly — Session Context (AI Handover)

## 1) Project Purpose

**I18nly** is a WordPress plugin (work in progress) focused on simplifying i18n/l10n workflows.

The long-term product goal is to hide low-level translation file complexity from end users while keeping full compatibility with WordPress standards and tooling.

## 2) Current Repository State

- Main plugin folder: `plugin/`
- Main plugin file: `plugin/i18nly.php`
- Admin page class: `plugin/includes/class-i18nly-admin-page.php`
- Plugin index guard: `plugin/index.php`
- License text: `LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt`
- Setup/overview doc: `README.md`

### Implemented so far

- A first working plugin bootstrap exists.
- A top-level admin sidebar menu entry (**Translations**) exists.
- Admin pages now follow WordPress patterns:
	- `All translations` (WP-style table),
	- `Add translation` (form),
	- `Edit translation` (details view).
- The `Add` flow creates a translation and redirects to the same `Edit translation` page used by list row links.

## 3) UX/Product Direction Agreed in Session

The core user object should be a **Translation** entity.

A Translation is identified by:

- object type (plugin first; theme/core later),
- source language (English first),
- target language.

Expected workspace actions:

- open,
- close,
- save,
- reload,
- switch via tabs between opened translations.

Guiding UX principle: users manipulate translations, not raw POT/PO/MO/JSON internals.

## 4) Technical Direction Agreed in Session

### Interaction model

- Use AJAX endpoints for fluid UX in the admin workspace.
- Keep operations asynchronous for expensive jobs (extract/build/compare).

### Storage model

- Translation entities are currently stored as a custom post type (`i18nly_translation`).
- Translation identity fields are stored in post meta:
	- `_i18nly_source_slug`,
	- `_i18nly_target_language`.
- Entry-level data is expected to move to a dedicated custom table later when editing workflows become richer.

### Build pipeline intent

- On reload/open refresh: extract source strings and regenerate POT context when needed.
- On save: chain generation of POT, MO, and JSON artifacts.
- Use WP-CLI i18n and gettext classes (no shell dependency assumption in product logic).

### Localization of I18nly itself

- The plugin UI itself must be localizable.
- JS translations must use WordPress JSON translation files.

## 5) Compliance Constraints

- Full WordPress standards compliance is required.
- Full REUSE compliance with `GPL-3.0-or-later` is required.
- Comments and documentation must be in English.

### Practical note from this session

For this repository setup, SPDX metadata in PHP files can be placed in file docblocks (example style already applied in plugin PHP files).

## 6) Devcontainer / Graft Rules (Important)

This repository uses `evlist/codespaces-grafting` for Codespace provisioning and workflow scaffolding.
This context is important when interpreting `.devcontainer/` behavior and CI/ZIP workflow conventions.

Do **not** customize managed files in `.devcontainer/` unless they are local override files.

- Avoid modifying managed files such as `.devcontainer/.cs_env` directly.
- Put custom env variables in `.devcontainer/.cs_env.d/[priority]-[name].local.env`.

Active local override file created in this session:

- `.devcontainer/.cs_env.d/30-i18nly.local.env`

Current intent of that file:

- local plugin linking (`PLUGIN_SLUG=i18nly`, `PLUGIN_DIR=plugin`),
- optional extra local plugin install (`WP_PLUGINS=plugin-check`),
- workflow runtime defaults for CI/ZIP targeting `plugin/`.

## 7) CI/Workflow Notes

Repository includes graft workflows:

- `.github/workflows/cs-grafting-ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/cs-grafting-plugin-zip.yml`

Configured workflow path target should be `plugin` for this project.

Current selected CI suites in local override are oriented to standards/licensing checks (WPCS + REUSE), with PHP 8.3.

## 8) XP Principles (Team Rule)

Implementation should now follow an explicit **Extreme Programming (XP)** workflow.

Core principles for this repository:

1. **Tiny vertical slices only**
	- implement one very small user-visible increment at a time,
	- avoid speculative architecture or schema expansion.

2. **Strict test-first (Red → Green → Refactor)**
	- start by writing or strengthening one failing test that expresses the expected behavior,
	- run tests before implementation and record the failing state (**Red**),
	- implement the minimal code change to pass (**Green**),
	- run a refactoring pass at constant behavior, then rerun tests (**Refactor**).

3. **Behavior-oriented tests over implementation mirroring**
	- prefer assertions on observable business outcomes/invariants,
	- avoid tests that only mirror internal implementation details,
	- include idempotence/regression checks when relevant to reduce shared reasoning errors.

4. **Validate continuously**
	- run focused checks first (lint/unit), then standards checks,
	- do not defer validation to the end of a long sequence.

5. **One step, one commit**
	- each completed slice should be committed independently,
	- commit messages should describe one behavior change only.

6. **Prefer deletion over speculation**
	- remove temporary scaffolding that is not part of the current slice,
	- keep docs and code aligned with what is actually implemented.

7. **Session reporting discipline**
	- explicitly report slice status as **Red**, **Green**, then **Refactor** before commit,
	- if a step is skipped, state why and treat it as an exception.

## 9) Next Steps (XP Order)

1. Add actions on `All translations` (for example trash/untrash) with minimal status handling.
2. Expand `Edit translation` page from read-only details to first editable translation entries.
3. Continue Slice 3 admin decomposition until `WP_I18nly\\Admin\\AdminPage` is a thin admin facade only.
4. Introduce dedicated entry storage (custom table) while keeping translation entity in CPT + meta.
5. Repeat with the same loop: implement → validate → commit.

## 11) Psalm Compatibility & Usage

### Compatibility Issues

Psalm is used for static analysis and dead code detection. Recent versions (Psalm 6.x) require PHP >=8.3.16, which may not match the devcontainer or CI environment. Additionally, global Composer installs can conflict with other tools (e.g., PHPUnit 11), making it impractical to install Psalm globally alongside other dependencies.

### Installation in Temporary Directory

To avoid conflicts, install Psalm in a dedicated directory (outside Composer global):

```bash
mkdir -p /home/vscode/.local/psalm5
cd /home/vscode/.local/psalm5
composer require --dev vimeo/psalm:^5
```

This keeps Psalm isolated and avoids dependency issues.

### Usage Instructions

To run Psalm with the workspace-local config and stubs:

```bash
php /home/vscode/.local/psalm5/vendor/bin/psalm --config=.vscode/psalm-plugin.xml --output-format=compact
```

For dead code detection:

```bash
php /home/vscode/.local/psalm5/vendor/bin/psalm --config=.vscode/psalm-plugin.xml --output-format=json --find-unused-code
```

The config and stubs are located in `.vscode/`. Stubs are enriched to reduce false positives from WordPress dynamic hooks.

## 12) POT Import Strategy Notes

Planned import logic must eventually reconcile three potential inputs:

- source POT data,
- optional PO data shipped with the plugin,
- entries already persisted in the database.

Expected runtime scenarios include plugin upgrades with or without attached PO updates.

Current MVP slice scope is intentionally narrower:

- import and persist source entries from POT only,
- postpone PO merge/conflict policies to later slices,
- keep POT header persistence separate from translation post-meta when shared across multiple translations.

### TODO (future slice)

- Add a dedicated settings page to manage editable POT header defaults
	(for example `Language-Team`, `Last-Translator`, contact values),
	while keeping template-specific placeholders when appropriate.

## 12) Third-Party Dependency Governance Note

Current project constraints include vendored third-party sources under `plugin/third-party/`
that may be overwritten by update scripts.

For security/compliance fixes affecting vendored upstream code, prefer this durable path:

1. maintain fixes in upstream-friendly branches/forks,
2. propose fixes as upstream PRs,
3. consume pinned fork references when upstream is not yet released,
4. rebase/merge upstream regularly to reduce long-term drift.

Avoid relying on ad-hoc local edits in vendored code as a permanent strategy.

## 13) Potential TODOs

### Evaluate `wp_mock` for unit tests

Potential improvement: reduce custom WordPress stubs in PHPUnit bootstrap by using `wp_mock` for selected unit tests.

Constraints for this repository:

- do not add test tooling to `plugin/composer.json`,
- install in a dedicated external Composer directory (similar to isolated Psalm setup),
- document setup so local and CI usage stay reproducible.

Suggested spike scope:

1. migrate one high-mock test class,
2. compare readability/maintenance cost vs current bootstrap stubs,
3. decide whether to generalize progressively.

## 14) PSR-4 Autoload Management

The plugin runtime now uses a single Composer PSR-4 autoloader.

### Current Runtime Model

- runtime autoload file: `plugin/third-party/vendor/autoload.php`,
- namespace root: `WP_I18nly\\`,
- namespace path: `plugin/includes/WP_I18nly/`,
- legacy custom `spl_autoload_register` loader has been removed,
- classmap fallback has been removed.

### Composer Configuration

`plugin/composer.json` uses:

```json
"autoload": {
	"psr-4": {
		"WP_I18nly\\": "includes/WP_I18nly/"
	}
}
```

Runtime dependencies remain in `plugin/third-party/vendor` (`vendor-dir` override).

### Operational Commands

After class/file moves or namespace changes:

```bash
composer dump-autoload --working-dir=plugin
phpunit
```

Recommended focused checks:

```bash
php -l plugin/includes/WP_I18nly/<ClassName>.php
phpcs --standard=.vscode/phpcs.xml plugin/includes/WP_I18nly/<ClassName>.php
```

### Contribution Rules For New Classes

- place new runtime classes under `plugin/includes/WP_I18nly/`,
- use `namespace WP_I18nly\\...;` with explicit sub-namespaces by responsibility,
- prefer domain-oriented namespaces (`Admin`, `Admin\\UI`, `Support`, `Build`) over generic buckets,
- use PSR-4 class/file naming (for example `FooBar.php` for `WP_I18nly\\FooBar`),
- avoid reintroducing legacy `I18nly_*` class names for runtime code,
- keep tests updated to require or reference the namespaced classes.

## 15) Slice 3 Decomposition Direction (Admin)

Primary architectural concern identified after PSR-4 migration: current `AdminPage` and `AdminPageHelper` remain too broad and mix UI orchestration with technical utilities.

### Current status (March 2026)

Slice 3 is **in progress**, not closed.

Implemented so far:

- edit-screen behavior has been extracted into `WP_I18nly\\Admin\\TranslationEditController`,
- admin orchestration classes now live under `WP_I18nly\\Admin` (`AdminPage`, `TranslationAjaxController`, `TranslationSaveHandler`),
- UI-specific collaborators exist under `WP_I18nly\\Admin\\UI` (messages, list columns, edit assets, meta box renderer, entries list table),
- technical collaborators exist under `WP_I18nly\\Support`,
- storage collaborators exist under `WP_I18nly\\Storage`,
- plural rules now live under `WP_I18nly\\Plurals\\PluralFormsRegistry`.

Still pending:

- `WP_I18nly\\Admin\\AdminPage` remains a large multi-responsibility class,
- admin orchestration, UI wiring, and technical glue are still partially concentrated in that facade,
- therefore Slice 3 should be tracked as ongoing until `AdminPage` is reduced to thin composition/root wiring.

### Target decomposition

- split edit-screen behavior (`post-new.php` and `post.php`) into a dedicated component (for example `TranslationEditController`),
- keep high-level admin hook wiring in a thin admin controller/facade,
- separate UI/rendering responsibilities from technical helpers.

### Suggested namespace structure

- `WP_I18nly\\Admin\\...` for admin controllers,
- `WP_I18nly\\Admin\\UI\\...` for renderers/list table/view helpers,
- `WP_I18nly\\Support\\...` (or `Infrastructure`) for technical utilities and integration details.

`AdminPage` specifically belongs in an admin/application namespace (facade/controller role), **not** in `Admin\\UI`.

### Incremental migration strategy

1. extract translation edit flow from `AdminPage` into a dedicated class,
2. move pure UI helpers out of `AdminPageHelper` into `Admin\\UI` classes,
3. move technical utility methods into support/infrastructure classes,
4. keep behavior stable with tests at each extraction step.

This direction is intended to reduce static coupling, improve readability, and prepare upcoming admin features (including future settings pages).

## 16) Build Namespace Direction (POT Pipeline)

To avoid a catch-all `Utils` namespace, POT pipeline classes have been moved toward an explicit build-oriented namespace.

Implemented target:

- `WP_I18nly\\Build\\PotGenerator`,
- `WP_I18nly\\Build\\PotSourceImporter`,
- `WP_I18nly\\Build\\PotSourceEntryExtractor`,
- `WP_I18nly\\Build\\PotWorkspaceService`.

Rationale:

- these classes express a domain workflow (artifact build/import),
- `Build` is more explicit and maintainable than generic `Utils`,
- it aligns with the same responsibility-first namespace strategy used for `Admin` and `Support`.

Migration pattern used successfully (small XP slices):

1. move one class,
2. update imports/usages/tests,
3. run focused checks (`php -l`, `phpunit`),
4. commit,
5. repeat.

## 17) Plural Forms Data Source Strategy (Source Of Truth)

### Problem Statement

Current `PluralFormsRegistry` readability is impacted by mixed concerns:

- language rules,
- UI defaults (markers/tooltips),
- fallback and normalization logic.

This makes targeted changes (for example changing bullets/markers for one language) harder than necessary and reduces traceability to public references.

### Transparency Requirement

Plural data must be reproducible from documented public sources, not from implicit model knowledge.

Reference direction agreed in session:

- use public CLDR plural data as canonical language baseline,
- keep I18nly-specific UI choices (markers/tooltips/overrides) explicit,
- document provenance and generation steps.

### Preferred Architecture

Use a two-layer source model plus a build step:

1. **Public baseline data** (CLDR-derived input snapshot with pinned version/source URL).
2. **Project overrides in PHP** (rule-based transforms, not static-only key/value).
3. **Generator script** in `scripts/` merges baseline + overrides.
4. **Generated runtime artifact** in plugin code is PHP (autoload/OPcache-friendly).

This keeps runtime simple and fast while preserving maintainable and auditable source inputs.

### Why PHP Overrides (instead of JSON-only overrides)

A PHP override layer enables expressive rules without building a custom DSL:

- language-specific custom tooltips,
- rule-based markers for language groups (for example all locales with `nplurals > 2`),
- conditional transforms based on normalized spec.

Maintainers of this plugin are expected to know PHP already, so this increases practical flexibility with low cognitive overhead.

### Alternative Options Considered

1. **Single JSON for all locales**
	- pros: easy diffing and schema validation,
	- cons: less expressive for conditional rules.

2. **One JSON file per locale**
	- pros: simple targeted edits,
	- cons: many files and weaker support for global conditional policies.

3. **Database source**
	- pros: dynamic updates,
	- cons: unnecessary runtime complexity for mostly static linguistic rules.

4. **Runtime cache layer**
	- useful as optimization,
	- not a substitute for a clear and auditable source-of-truth model.

### Suggested Repository Shape

- `scripts/plurals/` for source baseline + PHP overrides + generator,
- `plugin/includes/WP_I18nly/Plurals/` for generated runtime map and registry reader,
- `docs/` references to CLDR version and provenance.

### Governance Rules For This Strategy

1. Treat baseline CLDR snapshot and override code as authoritative inputs.
2. Keep generated plugin artifacts deterministic and reproducible.
3. Require tests (golden/regression) around generation output for key locales.
4. Document every baseline update with source version and changelog notes.

### Current Upstream Baseline Pin (March 2026)

- Canonical CLDR source file: `common/supplemental/plurals.xml` in `unicode-org/cldr`.
- JSON ingestion source: `cldr-core/supplemental/plurals.json` in `unicode-org/cldr-json`.
- Current pinned snapshot in repository: `scripts/plurals/upstream/plurals-48.1.0.json`.
- License for imported CLDR data: **Unicode License v3** (`Unicode-3.0`).
